* TODO Arity \(n\) functions and their API
* Languages
** Definition and implementation
A /language/ is given by specifying "functions'', "relations" and "constants"
along with the arity of each function and each relation. Note that languages are
purely syntactic -- they have no sematics (i.e. meaning assigned to them).

The words "functions", "relations", and "constant" are written in quotes here
to emphasize that these are just the names we give to these pieces of data. We
could equivalently have called them F, R, and C. They do not yet behave like
actual functions, relations and constants because we have not added any semantic
information to them. For now, they are merely symbols in our language.

In lean, we use *structure* to bundle data (think of it like classes in Python).
So, we bundle functions and relations in a structure and call it a language.

Implementation details --
1. Constants are included in the mathematical definition of languages but not in
   out immediate implementation of =lang= (see subsection that follows for an
   explanation).
2. The definition says that every function and relation is supposed to have an
   arity.  In our implementation, we invert this and instead stipulate that
   every arity (i.e. every natural number) has a type assiciated with it. What
   type is that? The type corresponding to \((n : ℕ)\) is the type of all
   \(n\)-arity functions in our language.
3. Thus, \(F : ℕ → Type\) is the function that returns a type for each natural
   number. Similarly for \(R\).
4. We also note that since each =lang= contains an =F= and an =R= that
   themselves return types, the type of =lang= itself is =Type 1=, which one
   universe higher than =Type=.  In other words, =Type= is too small to contain
   =lang=, so languages must live in a higher universe.  This is a small detail
   that does not affect the rest of treatment of model theory in any way.

** Constants
We define the constants in a language to simply be the \(0\)-arity functions
i.e. =L.F 0=. (Think of constants as simply a convenient way to refer to
\(0\)-arity functions). They do not add any new information to the =lang=
already defined above.
1. This uses the fact that natural numbers in Lean begin at \(0\), not \(1\).
2. This is the reason why we did not need to include constants in out
   implementation of languages.

** DLO language
The language that is of primary interest to us is the language of dense linear
ordering.

A /dense linear ordering (without endpoints)/ (DLO) is a language containing a
single binary relation symbol \((\le)\) satisfying some axioms. The exact axioms
are not important at the moment since axioms are semantic statements, while we
are interested only in syntactic statements right now.

Thus, a DLO's =lang= is a language with no constant, no functions and only one
binary relation. (Refer to the type theory primer for the meaning of =empty=,
=unit= etc.).

** =lang= is an inhabited type
We can now declare that =lang= is an inhabited (read: nonempty) type since we
know that =DLO_lang= is a =lang=. This declaration is made using Lean's
=instance= keyword. This declaration automatically makes the nonemptiness of
=lang= available as a fact to Lean's typeclass resolver if needed.

* Structures
Given a language \(L\), an /\(L\)-structure/ is a bundle of the following 4
pieces of data.

1. A set called the universe or domain. We implement this as a type rather than
   a set because Lean is based on type theory.

2. For every symbolic function of arity \(n\) in \(L\), we must have a
   corresponding real function of arity \(n\) acting on the universe of
   \(M\). To implement this, we map every =(f : L.F n)= to =Func univ v=. Since
   we need a name for this map, we name it =F=. Thanks to namespaces in lean,
   the full name for this map is =struc.F= or =M.F= where \(M\) is a =struc=,
   and hence there is no chance of mixing this up with =lang.F= or =L.F=. We
   will denote the interpretation of the symbolic function \(f\) under the
   structure \(M\) as =f^M=.

3. For every symbolic relation of arity \(n\) in \(L\), we must have a
   corresponding real relation of arity \(n\) on the universe of \(M\). At this
   point, it is useful to recall that the proper definition of a relation is as
   a subset if the domain set. What do I mean?  While we like to think of a
   binary relation for example as a relation "between" elements of our set, it
   is in fact better to view it as a subset of the Cartesian product of the
   domain with itself. Pairs belonging to this subset are related while pairs
   not belonging are not.  Similarly, \(3\)-ary relations are subsets of
   =univ³=, and so on. Thus we map each element =(r : L.R n)= to =set (vector
   univ n)=, i.e. we map to a set of length \(n\) vectors of =univ=. We will denote the interpretation of the symbolic relation \(r\) under the structure \(M\) as =r̂M=.

4. For every symbolic constant in \(L\), we must have a corresponding constant
   in the universe/domain. Since =L.C= is implemented outside of \(L\), we
   similarly implement =M.C= outside of \(M\). It is implemented as a
   restriction of =M.F= to \(0\)-arity functions.

** =struc= is inhabited
We can now declare that =struc L= is an inhabited (read: nonempty) type for
every language \(L\). In other words, every language has at least one structure
defined on it.

The default value for =struc L= has --
- a universe/domain with only one element
- corresponding to every symbolic function \(f\) in \(L\), =f^M= is the
  function that maps everything to the singleton element.
- corresponding to every symbolic relation \(r\) in \(L\), =r̂M= is the empty
  relation.

* Embedding between structures
** Embedding
Given two structures on the same language, an /embedding/ between them is a map
that is injective on the universe/domain and preserves the interpretation of all
the elements of the language.

For ease of writing, we first introduce some notation. Given a function of arity
\(n\) =(f : Func α n)=, and an \(n\)-vector \(v\), we will write \(f\otimes v\)
to mean that the function \(f\) is to be applied to the \(n\) elements of \(v\)
to yield a value in =α=.

To start, we let \(L\) denote the language, and \(M\) and \(N\) denote the
structures on \(L\). Then the map =η : M.univ → N.univ= is an embedding --
1. If \(\eta\) it is injective
2. For every \(n\)-vector \(v\) and every \(n\)-arity symbolic function \(f\) in
   \(L\), we have =η(f^M ⊗ v) = f^N ⊗ η(v)=, where \(\eta(v)\) denotes the
   vector obtained by mapping every coordinate of \(v\) under \(\eta\).
3. For every \(n\)-vector \(v\) and every \(n\)-arity symbolic relation \(r\) in
   \(L\), we have =v ∈ r̂M ↔ η(v) ∈ r̂N=, where \(\eta(v)\) again denotes the
   vector obtained by mapping every coordinate of \(v\) under \(\eta\).

** Embeddings are inhabited
We argue that every structure has an embedding to itself via the indentity map.

For this embedding, the \(\eta\) map is the identity map on the universe of
\(M\). This map is clearly injective and it trivially preserves the interpretation of every function, relation, and constant.

Thus, =embedding M M= is an inhabited type (read: nonempty), for every structure
\(M\).

** Isomorphism
An /isomorphism/ is a bijective embedding between two \(L\)-structures. To implement this, we define an isomorphism to be a structure in Lean that extends embeddings. This means --
1. there is a natural map =to_embedding : isomorphism M N → embedding M N=.
2. an isomorphism is the data contained in an embedding bundled with a proof of
   the bijectivity of the \(\eta\) map.

** Isomorphisms are inhabited
We argue that every structure has an isomorphism to itself via the identity map.

Thus, =isomorphism M M= is an inhabited type (read: nonempty), for every
structure \(M\).

** Cardinality of structure
The /cardinality/ of a structure is defined to be the cardinality of its domain. In Lean, the cardinals are their own separate type which is why we need to "make" the cardinal from the universe of \(M\).

We can then claim that if \(\eta : M \rightarrow N\) is an embedding of \(M\) in
\(N\), then the cardinality of \(M\) must be at most the cardinality of \(N\). In other words, only smaller structures can be embedded into larger structures.

The proof hinges on the injectivity of \(\eta\) and follows from the fact
=cardinal.mk_le_of_injective= (which is already proved in mathlib).

* Terms
Throughout this section, let \(L\) be a language and let \(M\) be an
\(L\)-structure.

** Definition of terms
\(L\)-/Terms/ are defined inductively as --
- constants of the language are all terms.
- there is a countably infinite supply of indexed "variables", each of which are
  also distinct terms.
- an \(n\)-ary symbolic function of \(L\) applied to exactly \(n\) other terms
  also yields a term.

This definition of terms has 2 distinct parts --
1. There are atomic terms like constants and variables,
2. There are higher-order terms (i.e. terms made of other terms) like ones
   formed by function application.

** TODO Implementation of terms
The trickiest part of the definition of terms is checking that in higher-order
terms, an \(n\)-ary symbolic function is being applied to exactly \(n\)-many
terms. This check needs a proof of a fact like =(length = n)=. However, we
cannot incorporate this proof into the definition directly without running into
lean's issues of nested inductive types.

Our solution is to incorporate the notion of atomic/higher-order into our
implementation. To each term we associate a level. We start by stipulating that
atomic terms have level \(0\). A symbolic function applied to all its arguments
also has level \(0\), while a partially applied function has positive level.

We summarize the term to level translation below --
| Term                       | Level                                           |
|----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| constant                   | 0                                               |
| variable                   | 0                                               |
| function                   | level = arity of the function                   |
| partially-applied function | level = arity \(-\) # arguments already applied |

* Formulas and Sentences
** Definition of a formula
An \(L\)-/formula/ on \(L\) is any one of the following "words" on the alphabet
\(L \cup \text{Var} \cup \{\top, \bot, =\}\), where Var denotes the set of all
variables --
1. \(\top\) and \(\bot\) are formulas
2. \(t_1 = t_2\) is a formula, where \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) are \(L\)-terms.
3. \(r t_1 \ldots t_n\) is a formula, where \(r\) is a symbolic \(n\)-ary
   relation in \(L\), and the \(t_i\)'s are \(L\)-terms.
4. If \(\phi, \psi\) are \(L\)-formulas, then so are \((\neg \phi)\),
   \((\phi\wedge\psi)\), and \((\phi\vee\psi)\). *Note:* we have added
   parenthesis here merely for ease of writing. They are not really a part of
   the formula.
5. If \(x\) is a variable, and \(\phi\) is an \(L\)-formula, then \(\exists x
   \phi\) and \(\forall x \phi\) are \(L\)-formulas.

** Implementation of a formula
We implement this definition of an \(L\)-formula inductively by enumerating all
the cases. Since we do not have a separate type for variables in our
implementation, we simply denote variable \(x_i\) by the natural number \(i\).

** Notation for logical operators
We then introduce some notation for logical operators. We mark all symbols with
a "prime" in order to distinguish them from Lean's built-in symbols for
equality, and, or, not etc.


| Symbol | Meaning                    |
|--------+----------------------------|
| ~='~   | formula.eq                 |
| =¬'=   | formula.neg                |
| =∧'=   | formula.and                |

| =⊤'=   | formula.tt                 |
| =⊥'=   | formula.ff                 |
| =→'=   | =¬'φ₁ ∨' φ₂=               |
| =↔'=   | =(φ₁ →' φ₂) ∧' (φ₂ →' φ₁)= |

** Free and bound variables
A variable /occurs freely/ in a formula if it present outside of a
quantification, meaning it occurs in the formula somewhere where it is not
immediately preceded by =∃'= or =∀'=.

We need to be careful with our implementation of this definition because it
contains two distinct ideas. A variable occurs freely in a formula if --
1. It occurs in a formula.
2. *Some* occurrence in the formula is free.

For example, in the formula \(\phi = \neg'(\forall' v_2 \top) \wedge' (v_1 ='
v_4)\wedge' (\exists v_3 (v_2 =' v_3))\),
- the variables \(v_1\) and \(v_4\) occur freely in the formula
- the variable \(v_3\) does not occur freely in the formula.
- the variable \(v_5\) does not occur freely in the formula (because it does not
  occur in the formula at all).
- Surprisingly, the variable \(v_2\) occurs freely in the formula.

** Definition of a sentence
A formula in which no variable occurs freely is a sentence.  We create a subtype
of \(L\)-formulas that we call \(L\)-sentences.

Every sentence is consequently a formula. The explicit map for this can be
written as
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
example : setence L → formula L := λ s, s.val
#+END_SRC

We wish to always be able to recover the formula underlying a sentence without
having to specify the above function explicitly. To do this, we declare a
=has_coe= instance from =sentence L= to =formula L=. Thereafter, we can always
reference the underlying formula of a sentence =s= as =↑s=.
