## Installation

following the instructions for your OS.

Navigate to the folder where you would like to clone this project.

Run the following `$ leanproject get vaibhavkarve/igl2020` in your
terminal or command prompt. This will create a new folder called
`igl2020` and it will copy mathlib oleans into it.

## Updating the project
You do not need to run `leanproject get ...` after the first time. To
get updated versions of all the files in this repository, you can run
standard git commands like `git pull` as often as you want.

## Files
All working code can be found in the `src` folder. No changes will be
made to files outside the `src` folder.
